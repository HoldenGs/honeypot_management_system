connect to the netcat listener! we already parse out
where we're supposed to connect to..

i think we could essentially write a telnet client,
connect to the honey server, and pipe it all through netcat
so it looks like it's a direct line to /bin/sh

just open the client, give a special user pass that
starts the server in 'netcat mode' where
there's no prompt, and pass control to netcat :)

server could look for user: net password: cat
and set a flag on the client obj that
determines if we're in telnet or netcat mode.
